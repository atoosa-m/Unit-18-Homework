You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

You’ll make the following updates to the provided Python file for this assignment, which already contains the basic `PyChain` ledger structure that you created throughout the module:

1. Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

2. Modify the existing `Block` data class to store `Record` data.

3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.
## About Streamlit ...
Founded in 2018, Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes creating and sharing custom web apps way easier for machine learning and data science projects. It allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data and machine learning models. Streamlit is more than just a way to make data apps, it's also a community of creators that share their apps and ideas and help each other make their work better.  
A major advantage of Streamlit is its quick and easy development flow and perhaps the biggest downside of it are its speed issues.
